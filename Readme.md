# Obys Agency

## Description
This is a website for a fictional agency called Obys Agency. The website is a one page website that contains information about the agency, the services they offer.

## What?
I learned how to add animations to a website using JavaScript libraries like ```GSAP``` and ```Locomotive Scroll```. I also explored the ```ScrollTrigger``` plugin, which triggers animations based on user scrolling. Additionally, I delved into 3D animations using ```Sherry.js```, which is built on the ```Three.js``` library. On this webpage, I created a 3D animation with a ```gooey effect```.
